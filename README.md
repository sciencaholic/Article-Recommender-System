# Article-Recommender-System
A Content-Based Recommender System which outputs articles containing similar words based on your search, using data from Hacker News. Can be easily modified to add users and their preferences.

The dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/hacker-news/hacker-news-posts

Since this is my first project on Machine Learning, it is very crude and basically made to get familiar with different algorithms, I took inspiration from Alex Klibisz's Kaggle kernel on the same dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/alexklibisz/simple-word-vectors-with-co-occurrence-pmi-and-svd

The code can be easily modified to add users and their preferences in place of input search word.
